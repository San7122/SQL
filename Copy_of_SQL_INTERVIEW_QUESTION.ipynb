        "**2.Explain the difference between SQL and NoSQL.**\n",
        "\n",
        "SQL: Uses structured query language for defining and manipulating data. It is used with relational databases, which store data in tables with predefined schemas. Examples include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server.\n",
        "\n",
        "NoSQL: Stands for \"Not Only SQL\" and refers to a variety of database systems that do not use SQL as their primary interface. These are often used for non-relational or distributed databases and can handle unstructured or semi-structured data. Examples include MongoDB, Cassandra, and Redis.\n",
        "\n",

        "Unique keys can contain NULL values, whereas primary keys cannot.\n",
        "\n",
        "**8. Explain the concept of indexes. Why are they used?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Indexes are database objects that improve the speed of data retrieval operations on a table. They work like an index in a book, allowing the database to find data more quickly without scanning the entire table. Indexes can be created on one or more columns of a table.\n",
        "\n",
        "**9. What is a join in SQL? Explain different types of joins.**\n",
        "\n",
        "Joins are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on related columns. Types of joins include:\n",

        "INNER JOIN: Returns rows with matching values in both tables.\n",
        "\n",
        "LEFT JOIN (LEFT OUTER JOIN): Returns all rows from the left table and the matched rows from the right table. Unmatched rows from the left table will have NULLs in columns of the right table.\n",

        "Normalization is the process of organizing data to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. The normal forms include:\n",
        "\n",
        "1NF (First Normal Form): Ensures that the table has a primary key and each column contains atomic (indivisible) values.\n",
        "\n",
        "2NF (Second Normal Form): Meets 1NF criteria and ensures that all non-key columns are fully dependent on the primary key.\n",
        "\n",
        "3NF (Third Normal Form): Meets 2NF criteria and ensures that all columns are dependent only on the primary key, eliminating transitive dependencies.\n",
        "\n",
        "BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form): A stricter version of 3NF where every determinant must be a candidate key.\n",

        "**11.What is denormalization? Why and when is it used?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Denormalization is the process of combining tables to reduce the number of joins and improve read performance. It is used when read performance is more critical than write performance, and when the database is subject to complex queries.\n",
        "\n",
        "**12.What is a view in SQL? How is it different from a table?**\n",
        "A view is a virtual table created by a query that combines data from one or more tables. Unlike a table, a view does not store data itself but provides a way to access data in tables. Views can be used to simplify complex queries, provide security by restricting access to specific data, and present data in a specific format.\n",
        "\n",
        "**13. Explain the difference between DELETE and TRUNCATE commands **\n",
        "\n",
        "DELETE: Removes specific rows from a table based on a condition. It can be rolled back and triggers are activated during its execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "TRUNCATE: Removes all rows from a table. It cannot be rolled back, is faster than DELETE, and does not activate triggers.\n",
        "\n",
        "**14.What is a stored procedure? How is it different from a function?**\n",
        "\n",
        "A stored procedure is a set of SQL statements that can be executed as a single unit. Differences include:\n",
        "\n",
        "Stored Procedure: Can perform actions (like modifying data) and return multiple values or none at all. It can also include control-of-flow statements.\n",
        "Function: Must return a single value and cannot perform actions that modify data. It is used primarily for computations and cannot have side effects.\n",
        "\n",
        "**15. What are transactions in SQL? Explain the ACID properties**.\n",
        "Transactions are sequences of operations performed as a single logical unit of work. ACID properties include:\n",
        "\n",
        "Atomicity: Ensures all operations within a transaction are completed successfully or none at all.\n",
        "\n",
        "Consistency: Ensures the database remains in a consistent state before and after the transaction.\n",
        "\n",
